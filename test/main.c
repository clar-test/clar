 * Sample main() for clar tests.

 * You should write your own main routine for clar tests that does specific
 * setup and teardown as necessary for your application.  The only required
 * line is the call to `clar_test(argc, argv)`, which will execute the test
 * suite.  If you want to check the return value of the test application,
 * your main() should return the same value returned by clar_test().
